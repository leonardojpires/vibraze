# 🎸 Vibraze

**Vibraze** is an online platform where users can discover bands and add them to their favorites, filter them by their genres or through a search input.
At first, this was an academic project for my Web-Server Programming Subject, but I intend to take this project further and turn it into a real online place for people to talk about everything related to metal and rock! 🤟🎸
